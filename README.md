# CAPYCORDER

Chrome extension, generating Capybara request spec steps based on user interaction.

## The plan!

* get basic functionality working using the current structure
* test in actual project to get the capybara syntax right
* write "integration" tests
* extract classes/singletons as described in TODOs and refactor
* write unit tests
* publish!
